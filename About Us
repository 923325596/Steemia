Security:

This app relies on SteemConnect which means that your information will be always secured and will not be shared with us or any other party. In addition, we add an extra security layer, this application encrypts the token received from SteemConnect which is for certain broadcast actions in the blockchain.

In short, there is no way to get your account compromised by using this app since we do not store your private key nor your master password. In fact, the token received from SteemConnect is stored and encrypted on the end user device which means that the only device capable to decrypt it is yours.

Fees:

Like other applications in the Steem Blockchain, we do take a 15% fee from each post made from the app. This 15% is breaking down in the following:


- 10% to cover Steemiaâ€™s server and/or cloud storage for assets.
- 5% to power up our bot voting account to support our users.

Enjoy yourself as you surf through the App.
